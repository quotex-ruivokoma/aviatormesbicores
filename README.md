# Aviator Free Bonus: How to Play and Win with Bonus and Promo Codes

## What is Aviator?

Aviator is a simple yet exciting multiplayer game where you monitor a
rising airplane. The goal is to cash out before the plane flies away,
which happens at random intervals. The longer the plane flies, the
higher the multiplier gets, but if you wait too long, you risk losing
your bet.
